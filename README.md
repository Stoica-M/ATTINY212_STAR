# ATTINY212_STAR
ATTINY 212, star lighting control
I changed the classic circuit that kept that little star pointed all the time and included a small circuit that would automatically turn on and off the play of lights, so I set it to turn on for one hour a day every day.
due to the lack of an external crystal, the start-up time decays over time
